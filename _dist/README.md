## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to work with CSS animations. Also learend how to hide and show content with only CSS.

Working with images is stil a struggle, but I'm learning ðŸ˜€.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

_Loading images based on screen size_

```html
<picture class="accordion__image--main">
  <source
    media="(min-width: 800px)"
    srcset="images/illustration-woman-online-desktop.svg"
  />
  <img
    src="images/illustration-woman-online-mobile.svg"
    alt="Just a nice image"
  />
</picture>
```

_Here the show and hide with CSS magic happens_

```css
.accordion__input:checked ~ .accordion__label::after {
  transform: translateY(-50%) rotate(0.5turn);
}
```

### Continued development

Need to learn more about responsive images and how to place them on the pages. Mobile and Desktop with a minimum of CSS declarations.
